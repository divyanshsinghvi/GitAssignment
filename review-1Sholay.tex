\maketitle
The movie is one of the marvellous example of exccellent videography with amazing plot and good enactment of the events.The film touches the heart of its audience with beautiful emotional scenes showing love and friendship.The movie is full packed movie with various genres :Action/ Comedy/ Romance/ Drama/ Adventure/ Music/ Crime  handled very well.The movie has excellent songs and became the most successful film of its time.It's a must watch movie.I would be suprised if there is a person who havent seen it yet.  


Sholay is really an epic hindi film.it has the biggest of actors in form of amitabh bacchan,dharmendra,hema malini,amjad khan and the list goes on but the director Ramesh sippi is top class too.songs of the movie are evergreen which are liked even the modern era and the dialoges are really class apart.
I would recommend it not only to the first timers but also to people who have already watched it.it is long but is a very interesting movie
