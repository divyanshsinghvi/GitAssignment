\maketitle
I would rate the movie with a 8.6/10. Rang De Basanti - a movie with a lot of controversies was completely different from my expectation.The message in the movie was clear along with showing great sense of humour  and a film for the youth of the country. The music of A.R. Rehman is icing on the cake. The college scenes showed in the movie makes the viewers to go back into their college days.The movie is not a emotional drama but a cult movie. It's a must watch movie. 

Rang de basanti is a great film.it is motivational film about the freedom fighters of india namely, rajguru,sukhdev and bhagat singh.The film has aamir khan,Mr. perfectionist, along with him, it has Soha ali khan,kunal kapoor,Siddharth and Sharman joshi,who go through an entire roller coaster of changes.
Overall it is a must watch film as the transition,the speed at which the the film moves,and all the sequences fall in place very well without boring the audiencefor for a single minute.
