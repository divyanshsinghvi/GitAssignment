Rang de basanti is a great film.it is motivational film about the freedom fighters of india namely, rajguru,sukhdev and bhagat singh.The film has aamir khan,Mr. perfectionist, along with him, it has Soha ali khan,kunal kapoor,Siddharth and Sharman joshi,who go through an entire roller coaster of changes.
Overall it is a must watch film as the transition,the speed at which the the film moves,and all the sequences fall in place very well without boring the audiencefor for a single minute.
